### Internals

----

The *internals* module contains definitions of *RPC* structures that are
internally used by *Windows* and that are not exposed in public header files. 
Some of these structures are architecture dependent, whereas others are shared.
Struct definitions from this module have been basically copied from the
[RpcView](https://www.rpcview.org/) project.
